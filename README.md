# Crispy Doom Linux Binaries
Better Linux builds for Crispy Doom. Pretty simple.
# Installation
It can be run anywhere, but the install.sh script I've made can install it to `/crispy-doom` and add shortcuts to the applications menu. Just go to the directory in the terminal, run `./install.sh`, confirm by typing `Y` after the prompt, and enter your password.
